# Yaflengine

Yaflengine stands for _Yet Another Fuzzy Logic Engine_. The framework adds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">Fuzzy Logic</a> capabilities to your projects. Some features of the engine are listed below:

 + Create/Modify models at runtime.
 + Load/Save models. The file format used is that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">Windows INI</a> files.
 + Nest models together into a single execution run to perform complex calculations.
 + Allow modifiers in rule syntax.

The framework is written enterely in C++ and compiles both in Windows and Linux. The author has even compiled it in a Raspberry Pi running Arch Linux.
