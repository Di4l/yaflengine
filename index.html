<p>
  Here you'll find information about the project, download links to the latest releases and links to API documentation.
  <br><br>
  Yaflengine stands for "Yet Another Fuzzy Logic Engine". It is entirely written in C++ and compiles under Linux and Windows (via MinGW). It provides a series of classes to help creating fuzzy logic models and perform calculations.
  Fuzzy models are stored in text files using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">.ini file</a> format, but can also be created at runtime. Value functions (truth functions if you wish) can be defined,
  although common ones are already built in the library (Gaussian bell, s-shaped, triangular, ...).
  <br><br>
  Rules syntax is very similar to plain english, so it is very easy to understand and learn. Take a look at the followin example:
</p>  

<pre><code>if mode.takeoff then throttle.full
if mode.takeoff and speed.not.stall then pitch.little.up
if mode.takeoff and airborne.true then gear.retract
if mode.takeoff and airborne.true then mode.flying
</code></pre>

<p>
  The example shows a possible model for an UAV take-off procedure. You may have noticed two things about the syntax:<br>
  <br>1. As you may have noticed, the syntax understands several modifiers such as <code>.not</code>, <code>.very</code> or <code>.little</code>.
  <br>2. Sets can act as inputs, outputs or both. this, I think (I may be wrong here) this is not a common feature of fuzzy engines.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">Fuzzy Logic</a> was born in the 1920s as infinite-valued logic, but the term "Fuzzy Logic" was first introduced in 1965 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotfi_A._Zadeh">Lotfi A. Zadeh</a>. It is not the prupose of this site to explain what fuzzy logic is, but I will take a few lines to give MY view of what it is.

<a name="library-history" class="anchor" href="#library-history"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Library history</h3>

<p>I wrote this library around 2005 or so for the solely purpose of understanding fuzzy logic. It has ever since gone through several updates.
<br><br>
The first version lacked the rule modifiers and Set dual roles in a single model. To use a Set both as an input and output one had to create two independent models, load both independently, and run them in the required order to achieve what was needed. It was very messy. On top of that, it was written for the C++Builder compiler and it included features only understood by it (<code>__property</code>, for example).
<br><br>
The first update changed the code to make it compile by the GNU C++ compiler g++ both in Linux and Windows. The library became multiplatform (or dual-platform at least).
<br><br>
The next update introduced modifiers in the rule syntax.
<br><br>
The major change to this date came in adding the posibility of having sets play an input and output role within the same model. This meant changing the calculation chain rules. The classes TExecData and TFuzzyExec were born. The engine is now inteligent enough to know which sets are pure inputs, pure outputs and input/output and generate the correct calculation chain to generate the final outputs. In fact one can concatenate any number of calculation levels on the chain, and it is completely transparent to the user.

<p>If you wish to collaborate to the project in any ways you may think you can do so in several ways. You can ask to become a collaborator by contacting me (<a href="https://github.com/Di4l" class="user-mention">@Di4l</a>) and letting me know. I only ask for one thing; have some C++ knowledge. No need to be a guru. I myself am not a guru (as you will notice if you look at the source code). you can also download the source code, modify it and then request a pull stating what you have changed and why.</p>
<p>You may also simply suggest knew features, changes or notify of any bugs found. I will do my best to incorporate those changes if I find them sensible and find the time.</p>
