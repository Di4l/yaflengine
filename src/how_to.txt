This code has been compiled using eclipse + CDT. It has been compiled in Linux and Windows (using MinGW).

To compile using eclipse:
-------------------------

1. Start-up eclipse, set the workspace to the directory where this file is.
2. Add to the workspace the fuzzy and ini_file projects (import->general->existing project).
3. Compile project ini_file and then fuzzy.

NOTE:
The file fuzzy.cpp is set to be ignored from project compilation. It is there to generate a dynamic library from within the C++Builder compiler. I no longer use it, bu people may find it useful.
